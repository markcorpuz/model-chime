# setup-child
**Version 1.0.0**

This repo is a starting point for creating child themes based on Bill Eriksons' Genesis starter theme (ea-genesis-child) and improvements made by Marks' modifications (setup-be).

# Goal

The goal of this theme is to create a starting point where derivatives of new layouts can be made from. Maintaining reusabality is important in as much as the capacity to update themes derived from these original templates.

# Notes

This site uses scss styles that are updated separately from the theme and preprocessed using Codekit. To access the full scss files, visit https://github.com/markcorpuz/setup-be-framework
